    "### Core idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the model reverse‑engineer the question from its own answer. If those synthetic questions embed close to the original question, the answer is probably on‑topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "1. Committal gate – filter out evasive answers (\"I'm not sure\"), they get automatic 0.\n",
    "2. Self‑question generation – call eval/answer_relevance/generate_question N times to create paraphrased questions that the answer would satisfy.\n",
    "3. Embeddings – encode original and synthetic questions with text-embedding-3-large (or model of your choice).\n",
    "4. Cosine similarity – average similarity across N questions → final score ∈ [‑1,1], rescaled to [0,1].\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    " graph LR\n",
    "     A[Answer] --> B{Is the answer committal?}\n",
    "     B -->|Yes| C[Generate paraphrased questions that the answer would satisfy]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it's useful\n",
    "- Works even when no explicit context is available (pure QnA setting).\n",
    "- Provides a continuous signal—great for ranking multiple candidate answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trade‑offs & tricks\n",
    "- N questions: 3–5 is usually enough; beyond that you pay extra tokens with diminishing returns.\n",
    "- Embedding model: larger models give crisper semantic space but cost more."
