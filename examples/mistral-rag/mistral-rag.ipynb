We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;\\n•the amount, quality, relevance, searchability, and timeliness of content available on our platform;\\n•the continued adoption of our products and services internationally;\\n•our ability, including in comparison to that of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products\\nand services;\\n•our ability to effectively adopt new technologies, such as machine learning and AI, that our competitors may have more experience utilizing\\nand leveraging in their products and services;\\n•changes mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements;\\n•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly engineers, designers, and product managers; and\\n•our reputation and the brand strength relative to our competitors.\\nIf we are not able to compete effectively for users, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe face intense competition for advertising spend and are subject to a rapidly evolving technological landscape. If we are unable to compete\\neffectively for advertising spend, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\\nWe face significant competition for advertising spend. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated We face significant competition for advertising spend. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated\\nthrough ads on our platform, and we compete against online and mobile businesses, including those referenced above, and traditional media outlets,\\nsuch as television, radio, and print, for advertising budgets. We also compete with advertising networks, exchanges, demand-side platforms, and other\\nplatforms for marketing budgets and in the development of the tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. In order to grow\\nour revenue and improve our results of operations, we must increase our share of advertising spend relative to our competitors, many of which are\\nlarger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially\\nbroader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services, as well as collect more personal data than we\\ndo, to gain additional share of advertising budgets. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertiser spend depends upon many factors\\nboth within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the size, composition, and engagement of our user base relative to those of our competitors;\\n•the availability of compelling and monetizable content on our platform;\\n•our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;\\n•our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;\\n•the pricing of our advertising products and services relative to those of our competitors;\\n•the strength of our advertiser relationships and services compared to those of our competitors;\\n•the ability for advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements on our platform;\\n35 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 45/281Table of Contents\\n•the return our advertisers receive from our advertising services relative to those of our competitors; and\\n•our reputation and the strength of our brand relative to our competitors.\\nIn addition, global economic concerns and geopolitical conditions continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability in the advertising market,\\nwhich we expect to increase competition for advertising spend. Furthermore, in recent years, there have been significant acquisitions and consolidation\\nby and among our actual and potential competitors. We anticipate this trend of consolidation will continue, which will present heightened competitive\\nchallenges for our business. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertiser spend, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\\nprospects would be adversely affected.\\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk of\\nyour investment.\\nWe have a limited operating history in new and unproven markets that may not develop as expected. We began our operations in 2005, but were\\nacquired by Condé Nast Publications in 2006. We did not begin operating as an independent, private company until we were spun out of Advance\\nMagazine Publishers Inc. (“Advance”), Condé Nast’s parent company, in 2011. Additionally, we did not begin meaningful monetization efforts at\\nReddit until 2018, and we are currently exploring new strategies for monetization. Our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our\\ncurrent business and our future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by\\ngrowing companies in rapidly changing industries, including challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting, the need for ongoing changes to growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting, the need for ongoing changes to\\nour products and business strategy, and other risks and uncertainties described in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus. If our\\nassumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\\nsuccessfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. Furthermore, there is no\\nassurance that our rate of growth will continue, if at all.\\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition,\\nand prospects.\\nTechnologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our ads. We generate substantially all of\\nour revenue from advertising, and ad blocking technologies may prevent the display of certain of our ads, which could harm our business, revenue, and\\nfinancial results. Existing ad blocking technologies that have not been effective on our service may become effective as we make certain product\\nchanges, and new ad blocking technologies may be developed. More Redditors may choose to use products that block or obscure the display of our ads\\nif we are unable to successfully balance the amount of organic content and paid advertisements, or if Redditors’ attitudes toward advertisements\\nbecome more negative. Further, regardless of their effectiveness, ad blockers may generate concern regarding the health of the digital advertising\\nindustry, which could reduce the value of digital advertising and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\\nWe rely on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such We rely on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such\\ncurrent or historical metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe regularly review metrics, including our DAUq metric, to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. We\\ncalculate our DAUq using internal company data. While this number is based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable\\nperiod of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring DAUq. DAUq is intended to capture traffic where a Reddit page has been viewed or\\nthe Reddit app opened at least once and, notably, include both traffic from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as from those who\\nhave not logged in to—or do not have—a registered account. In general, it is more challenging to accurately count logged-out traffic, since counting\\naccuracy is dependent on deduplicating traffic where we do not have a registered user identifier. While we use various techniques to detect whether the\\nsame user has performed multiple views, including cookies and traffic analysis, these techniques are not guaranteed to accurately deduplicate the\\ntraffic, especially for logged-out traffic. In addition, some visitors browse Reddit using an\\n36 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 46/281Table of Contents\\n“incognito” or “private browsing” mode. Given the privacy protections surrounding such traffic, we often do not have adequate information to\\naccurately deduplicate such traffic.\\nOur DAUq metrics may also be impacted by our efforts to reduce the number of false, spam, and bot accounts in existence on our platform. We\\nregularly deactivate false, spam, and bot accounts that violate our terms or policies, and exclude these users from the calculation of our DAUq metric;\\nhowever, we will not succeed in identifying and removing all false, spam, and bot accounts, which means that our DAUq count could be overstated.\\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to estimate the total number of false, spam, and bot accounts and eliminate them from the calculation\\nof our DAUq, although our quarterly average DAUq metric may continue to reflect such accounts if, in our view, the impact of their inclusion has an\\nimmaterial impact on our average DAUq for the given quarter. Moreover, a single person or organization may hold multiple accounts and may use\\nmore than one account to perform multiple views within a relevant period. We lack adequate information to effectively deduplicate such traffic from\\ndifferent registered accounts that may come from the same person or organization. As such, the calculation of our DAUq may not accurately reflect the\\nactual number of people or organizations using our platform.\\nA portion of our historical DAUq metric counts views of pages that are hosted using Google’s Accelerated Mobile Page (“AMP”) framework. The\\naccuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relies on the accuracy and completeness of information received from Google used to\\ncompute the DAUq metric. Unfortunately, the information provided by Google is not historically complete and consistent.

Furthermore, as we pursue\\nopportunities to empower our user economy, we expect to face competition from existing online marketplaces, including Facebook Marketplace,\\nNextdoor, Craigslist, Poshmark, Etsy, and Roblox. As a result, our competitors may draw users towards their products or services and away from ours.\\nThis could decrease the growth or engagement of Redditors, which, in turn, would negatively affect our business. In addition, we face competition\\nfrom large language models (“LLMs”), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Anthropic;\\n34 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 44/281Table of Contents\\nRedditors may choose to find information using LLMs, which in some cases may have been trained using Reddit data, instead of visiting Reddit\\ndirectly. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;\\n•the amount, quality, relevance, searchability, and timeliness of content available on our platform;\\n•the continued adoption of our products and services internationally;\\n•our ability, including in comparison to that of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products\\nand services;\\n•our ability to effectively adopt new technologies, such as machine learning and AI, that our competitors may have more experience utilizing\\nand leveraging in their products and services;\\n•changes mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements;\\n•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly engineers, designers, and product managers; and\\n•our reputation and the brand strength relative to our competitors.\\nIf we are not able to compete effectively for users, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe face intense competition for advertising spend and are subject to a rapidly evolving technological landscape. If we are unable to compete\\neffectively for advertising spend, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\\nWe face significant competition for advertising spend. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated We face significant competition for advertising spend. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated\\nthrough ads on our platform, and we compete against online and mobile businesses, including those referenced above, and traditional media outlets,\\nsuch as television, radio, and print, for advertising budgets. We also compete with advertising networks, exchanges, demand-side platforms, and other\\nplatforms for marketing budgets and in the development of the tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. In order to grow\\nour revenue and improve our results of operations, we must increase our share of advertising spend relative to our competitors, many of which are\\nlarger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially\\nbroader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services, as well as collect more personal data than we\\ndo, to gain additional share of advertising budgets. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertiser spend depends upon many factors\\nboth within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the size, composition, and engagement of our user base relative to those of our competitors;\\n•the availability of compelling and monetizable content on our platform;\\n•our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;\\n•our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;\\n•the pricing of our advertising products and services relative to those of our competitors;\\n•the strength of our advertiser relationships and services compared to those of our competitors;\\n•the ability for advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements on our platform;\\n35 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 45/281Table of Contents\\n•the return our advertisers receive from our advertising services relative to those of our competitors; and\\n•our reputation and the strength of our brand relative to our competitors.\\nIn addition, global economic concerns and geopolitical conditions continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability in the advertising market,\\nwhich we expect to increase competition for advertising spend. Furthermore, in recent years, there have been significant acquisitions and consolidation\\nby and among our actual and potential competitors. We anticipate this trend of consolidation will continue, which will present heightened competitive\\nchallenges for our business. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertiser spend, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\\nprospects would be adversely affected.\\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk of\\nyour investment.\\nWe have a limited operating history in new and unproven markets that may not develop as expected. We began our operations in 2005, but were\\nacquired by Condé Nast Publications in 2006. We did not begin operating as an independent, private company until we were spun out of Advance\\nMagazine Publishers Inc. (“Advance”), Condé Nast’s parent company, in 2011. Additionally, we did not begin meaningful monetization efforts at\\nReddit until 2018, and we are currently exploring new strategies for monetization. Our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our\\ncurrent business and our future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by\\ngrowing companies in rapidly changing industries, including challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting, the need for ongoing changes to growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting, the need for ongoing changes to\\nour products and business strategy, and other risks and uncertainties described in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus. If our\\nassumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\\nsuccessfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. Furthermore, there is no\\nassurance that our rate of growth will continue, if at all.\\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition,\\nand prospects.\\nTechnologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our ads. We generate substantially all of\\nour revenue from advertising, and ad blocking technologies may prevent the display of certain of our ads, which could harm our business, revenue, and\\nfinancial results. Existing ad blocking technologies that have not been effective on our service may become effective as we make certain product\\nchanges, and new ad blocking technologies may be developed. More Redditors may choose to use products that block or obscure the display of our ads\\nif we are unable to successfully balance the amount of organic content and paid advertisements, or if Redditors’ attitudes toward advertisements\\nbecome more negative. Further, regardless of their effectiveness, ad blockers may generate concern regarding the health of the digital advertising\\nindustry, which could reduce the value of digital advertising and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\\nWe rely on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such We rely on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates to calculate certain of our key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such\\ncurrent or historical metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nWe regularly review metrics, including our DAUq metric, to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. We\\ncalculate our DAUq using internal company data. While this number is based on what we believe to be reasonable calculations for the applicable\\nperiod of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring DAUq. DAUq is intended to capture traffic where a Reddit page has been viewed or\\nthe Reddit app opened at least once and, notably, include both traffic from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as from those who\\nhave not logged in to—or do not have—a registered account. In general, it is more challenging to accurately count logged-out traffic, since counting\\naccuracy is dependent on deduplicating traffic where we do not have a registered user identifier. While we use various techniques to detect whether the\\nsame user has performed multiple views, including cookies and traffic analysis, these techniques are not guaranteed to accurately deduplicate the\\ntraffic, especially for logged-out traffic. In addition, some visitors browse Reddit using an\\n36 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 46/281Table of Contents\\n“incognito” or “private browsing” mode. Given the privacy protections surrounding such traffic, we often do not have adequate information to\\naccurately deduplicate such traffic.\\nOur DAUq metrics may also be impacted by our efforts to reduce the number of false, spam, and bot accounts in existence on our platform. We\\nregularly deactivate false, spam, and bot accounts that violate our terms or policies, and exclude these users from the calculation of our DAUq metric;\\nhowever, we will not succeed in identifying and removing all false, spam, and bot accounts, which means that our DAUq count could be overstated.\\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to estimate the total number of false, spam, and bot accounts and eliminate them from the calculation\\nof our DAUq, although our quarterly average DAUq metric may continue to reflect such accounts if, in our view, the impact of their inclusion has an\\nimmaterial impact on our average DAUq for the given quarter. Moreover, a single person or organization may hold multiple accounts and may use\\nmore than one account to perform multiple views within a relevant period. We lack adequate information to effectively deduplicate such traffic from\\ndifferent registered accounts that may come from the same person or organization. As such, the calculation of our DAUq may not accurately reflect the\\nactual number of people or organizations using our platform.\\nA portion of our historical DAUq metric counts views of pages that are hosted using Google’s Accelerated Mobile Page (“AMP”) framework. The\\naccuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relies on the accuracy and completeness of information received from Google used to\\ncompute the DAUq metric.
