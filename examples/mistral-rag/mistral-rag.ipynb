We believe the importance of data to all\\ntypes of analytics and AI, from training to testing and refining models, positions us well to tap into this strong market.\\nUser Economy\\nCommerce is already at the core of many communities today. As we introduce new ways to enable developers to add additional\\nfunctionality to their communities, we believe there will be further development of economic features on Reddit (e.g., games). We\\nsee informal exchanges today of digital goods, services, and even physical goods. We recognize the opportunity that commerce\\npresents and we have continued to invest in the future of Reddit’s user economy. Using estimates from IDC’s Consumer Market\\nModel and focusing on six core geographies (United States, Canada, Australia, Western Europe, India, and Latin America), we\\nbelieve this market size is $1.3 trillion today, and it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to $2.1 trillion in 2027. We believe that\\nover time, we can generate revenue based on the volume of commerce that is conducted on Reddit.\\nRisks Associated with Our Business\\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making a decision to invest in our Class A\\ncommon stock. These risks are more fully described in “Risk Factors” immediately following this prospectus summary. These risks\\ninclude, among others, the following:\\n•If we fail to increase or retain our user base, and in particular, our DAUq, or if user engagement declines, our business,\\nresults of operations, financial condition, and prospects will be harmed.\\n•If Redditors do not continue to contribute content or their contributions are not valuable or appealing to other Redditors, we •If Redditors do not continue to contribute content or their contributions are not valuable or appealing to other Redditors, we\\nmay experience a decline in the number of Redditors accessing our products and services and in user engagement, which\\ncould result in the loss of advertisers and may harm our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and\\nprospects.\\n•Our business depends on a strong brand and reputation, and if we are unable to maintain and enhance our brand and\\nreputation, our ability to expand our user and advertiser bases will be impaired and our business, results of operations,\\nfinancial condition, and prospects could be harmed.\\n•Changes in internet search engine algorithms and dynamics could have a negative impact on traffic for our website and,\\nultimately, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\\n•We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\\n•Our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which makes them difficult to predict.\\n•We are in the early stages of monetizing our business and there is no assurance we will be able to scale our business for\\nfuture growth.\\n•We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers,\\nor the reduction of or failure by advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets would adversely affect our\\nbusiness.\\n•We may not succeed in further expanding and monetizing our platform internationally and may be subject to increased\\ninternational business and economic risks.\\n•We are exploring business opportunities in licensing data, but we are in the early stages and the market is new and evolving\\nrapidly.\\n•Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be harmed by our failure to timely and\\neffectively scale and adapt our existing technology and infrastructure. rapidly.\\n•Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects may be harmed by our failure to timely and\\neffectively scale and adapt our existing technology and infrastructure.\\n•We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to data privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify instances of\\nmisuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.\\n10 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 20/281Table of Contents\\n•If our security measures are breached, or if our products and services are subject to attacks involving our systems or data,\\nsome of which contain personal information, or that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services,\\nour products and services may be perceived as not being secure, Redditors and advertisers may curtail or stop using our\\nproducts and services, and our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be\\nharmed.\\n•Redditor growth and engagement depends upon effective interoperation with operating systems, networks, devices, web\\nbrowsers, online application stores, regulations, and standards that we do not control. Changes in our products or to those\\noperating systems, networks, devices, web browsers, online application stores, regulations, or standards may harm Redditor\\nretention, growth, and engagement, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\\nprospects.\\n•Our business is subject to increasingly complex and evolving laws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other legal\\nobligations regarding content, consumer protection, competition, privacy, and other matters. Failure to comply with such\\nlaws, rules, regulations, industry standards, and other legal obligations could harm our business.\\n•Interest in our Class A common stock from retail and other individual investors, for reasons unrelated to our underlying\\nbusiness or macro or industry fundamentals, could result in increased volatility in the market price of our Class A common\\nstock.\\n•The multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who\\nheld our capital stock prior to the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, including our directors, executive held our capital stock prior to the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE, including our directors, executive\\nofficers, and 5% stockholders, and their respective affiliates, who will hold in the aggregate     % of the voting power of our\\ncapital stock following the offering.

We define a daily active unique (“DAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on\\nthe Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period. We calculate average DAUq for a particular\\nperiod by adding the number of DAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. We measure DAUq\\nbecause we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand usage of and engagement with our platform. DAUq is the primary\\nmetric by which we measure the scale of our active user base.\\nDAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do not have—a\\nregistered account. Visitors that come to Reddit from search engines are generally not logged in and originate from both desktop and mobile web.\\nCurrently, monetization of these users is mainly through conversation pages and feed ads. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and\\ncomplex. For example, prior to the first quarter of 2023, a portion of our historical DAUq metric counted views of pages that were hosted using\\nGoogle’s Accelerated Mobile Page (“AMP”) framework. The accuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relied on the accuracy\\nand completeness of information received from Google, which had not been historically complete and consistent. As such, our historical DAUq\\nmetrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To the extent that our metric includes views of pages hosted on third-party\\ninfrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party. infrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party.\\nDAUq is shown globally and also broken out by the United States and the rest of the world because these markets have different characteristics.\\nMost notably, we are more advanced in engagement and monetization in the United States than in the rest of the world.\\nIn addition, we monitor logged-in DAUq, which we define as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the\\nReddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period and was logged in to a registered account. We\\nmeasure logged-in DAUq because these users tend to have higher engagement and spend more time on our platform compared to users who are not\\nlogged in to a registered account. Logged-in users often start their experience in a personalized feed with advertising and dive into post pages with\\nconversation page ads. These ads include display, video, and direct response as well as other ads for mobile applications, mobile web, and desktop\\nweb.\\n97 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 107/281Table of Contents\\nQuarterly Average DAUq\\n(in millions)\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth: 5% 5% 7% 7% 5% 7% 15% 27%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth: 18% 18% 20% 17% 13% 14% 19% 21%\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth:(2)% (1)% 2% 6% 6% 9% 19% 34% Total DAUq YoY Growth:12% 11% 11% 7% 4% 5% 12% 21%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth:15% 16% 18% 15% 12% 12% 16% 20% Logged-in DAUq YoY Growth:21% 19% 21% 19% 14% 16% 22% 21%\\nWe assess both year over year and quarter over quarter growth of DAUq in each period.\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023, global DAUq grew 27% compared to the prior year period, driven by 34% growth in DAUq in the\\nUnited States and 21% growth in DAUq in the rest of world. Global DAUq grew 11% compared to the prior quarter period, driven by 14% growth in\\nDAUq in the United States and 8% growth in DAUq in the rest of world. The growth in global DAUq in the three months ended December 31, 2023\\ncompared to the prior year period and prior quarter period was driven mainly by traction in our growth strategies, primarily from product\\nenhancements and third-party search engine and algorithm changes. Global monthly average DAUq was 76.0 million in December 2023, reflecting\\nmomentum in DAUq growth, particularly in logged-out users, as we exited the quarter, and we continued to add users in January 2024.\\nYear over year and quarter over quarter activity can also fluctuate due to various internal and external factors. For example, quarter over quarter\\ngrowth for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was 7%, as a result of\\n98 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 108/281Table of Contents\\nincreased user activity due in part to r/  EldenRing and other gaming-related communities, as well as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\\nWe saw a decline in global DAUq in the three months ended June 30, 2022, when strong quarterly DAUq growth fell in the absence of peaks in usage\\nsurrounding worldwide events and cultural trends. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we deployed further advances in our\\nprocess used to identify and address activity by users and visitors, including web crawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove\\nthem from our DAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate DAUq for prior periods if we assess such impact to be immaterial. As we have\\ncontinued to improve our capabilities to identify suspicious traffic, we have not seen this methodology materially impact trends in DAUq from quarter\\nto quarter.\\nWeekly Active Unique. We define a weekly active unique (“WAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a\\npage on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a trailing seven-day period. We calculate average\\nquarterly WAUq for a particular period by adding the number of WAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that\\nperiod. We measure WAUq because we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand the reach of our platform.\\nSimilar to DAUq, WAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do\\nnot have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of not have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of\\ninformation received from third parties. As such, our historical WAUq metrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year.

In the three months ended December 31, 2023, global WAUq increased 12% compared to\\nthe prior quarter period, driven by 16% growth in WAUq in the United States and 8% growth in WAUq in the rest of world. For the three months\\nended December 31, 2023, the proportion of DAUq to WAUq was 27%.\\nTrends in Monetization Metrics\\nWe monetize our business primarily through advertising on our mobile applications and website. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we\\nrecorded revenue of $804.0 million, as compared to revenue of $666.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 21%\\ncompared to the prior year period.\\nARPU. We define average revenue per unique (“ARPU”) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average DAUq in that\\ngeography. For the purposes of calculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given geography is based on the geographic location in which advertising\\nimpressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity, while other revenue in a given geography is based on the billing address\\nof the customer. This differs from the presentation of our revenue by geography in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this prospectus, where both advertising revenue and other revenue are based on the billing address of the customer.\\nWe present ARPU globally and also broken out on a United States and rest of world basis because we currently monetize users in the United', metadata={'page': 106, 'source': '/tmp/tmpphkw70ut', '_opper_id': 'a10bf65e-b72d-4549-a40e-6f189a059b53', 'file_name': 'reddit-sec.pdf', '_opper_key': '34/1816/fcdadc07-9703-4496-83d5-3c96360c4a65', '_opper_next': '0e90b6cb-aada-4f58-8807-bb63b5765396', '_opper_prev': 'a09005df-9c2f-46b8-8245-e771cba8da15', '_opper_index_file_id': 2741, '_opper_pdf_processor': 'pypdf'}), RetrievalResponse(content='04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 14/281Table of Contents\\n◦Elevating Conversations and Video. We believe that our investments and efforts to grow engagement and the richness\\nof our communities through more video, and more vibrant conversations will continue to convert our massive monthly\\nreach into more daily users. In December 2023, we experienced approximately 35% growth in the number of videos\\nwatched for 10 seconds or more and an approximately 16% increase in daily active video viewers compared to\\nDecember 2022. We also recognize that conversations are the heart of Reddit, with 27% of almost 3,200 Redditors\\nsurveyed across the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Mexico, and India identifying “reading comments” as\\ntheir top task to complete. In addition, we are focused on reducing the time it takes for users to access conversations, as\\nwell as providing them with better guidance on community rules when they comment to reduce moderated actions.\\n◦ Modernizing Search. While we are still in the early innings, search is already a key action taken on Reddit with an\\naverage of over 35 million daily search queries directly on Reddit in December 2023. We recognize the importance of\\nsearch, and have made significant investments to make searches more relevant and drive deeper engagement. We have\\nobserved 30% higher week-one retention (which measures the percentage of users who return to Reddit eight to 14\\ndays after first accessing Reddit) in users with any search activity compared to all users from October 2023 to\\nDecember 2023.\\n◦Customized Content Recommendations. We utilize AI to recommend relevant posts and communities, utilizing factors\\nsuch as search queries, post topics, and engagement with similar users to enhance both the search and discovery\\nexperience. We believe our investments in AI have improved new user onboarding and driven engagement with experience. We believe our investments in AI have improved new user onboarding and driven engagement with\\nexisting users. For example, we re-trained our New Home Feed ranking with significantly more data and user signals.\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, we observed an\\nincrease of over 30% in “Good Visits,” defined as a user consuming a post for more than 30 seconds.\\n•Grow Our International User Base. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, approximately 50% of Redditors\\nvisited the platform from outside of the United States. In the three months ended December 31, 2023, over 90% of all\\nReddit posts were made in English. We see a massive opportunity to grow in geographies outside of the United States and\\nin languages beyond English. We are beginning the work of translating our corpus of conversational data using translation\\nmodels to multiple different languages to increase our international growth. In particular, we are focused on growing\\nRedditors in the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Brazil, and India. Our strategy to land in these markets and then grow is\\ncentered around offering users culturally relevant and location-specific content. We also intend to use the Community Tab,\\nmachine-translated content, and highly relevant push notifications to help international users find and engage regularly with\\nlocally relevant and trending content. We have captured increased international momentum, with an average of 36.7 million\\ninternational DAUq for the three months ended December 31, 2023, representing 21% growth year over year.\\nWhy Advertisers Come to Reddit\\nReddit is the place where people, entities of public interest, and businesses come together to engage in human-to-human\\nconversations relevant to their interests. Across our diverse communities, people seek and share information in context about conversations relevant to their interests. Across our diverse communities, people seek and share information in context about\\nproducts and services, often with high purchase intent. We have made investments and acquisitions that have enabled us to be a\\nleader in contextual and interest-based advertising. Advertisers of all sizes rely on Reddit to find high-intent customers that they are\\nnot able to reach on traditional social media platforms.\\nAdvertisers come to Reddit for distinctive benefits:\\n•Contextual and Interest-based Advertising. Reddit’s advertising platform enables marketers to find relevant audiences on\\nthe Reddit platform using our interest graph and to reach users in contextually relevant communities and content, using\\nconversational and engaging formats. According to the User Perceptions Survey, 85% of respondents said Reddit is where\\nthey learn about the topics they love most. For example, an advertiser with a camping product can reach people who love\\noutdoor activities across Reddit. This is interest-based advertising. Similarly, the same advertiser can reach people who are\\nin a conversation in\\n5 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 15/281Table of Contents\\nr/  camping or r/   Outdoors exploring what gear they should buy. These people may see an ad for camping gear, in context,\\nwithin that conversation. That is contextual advertising. Reddit’s unique community structure and interest-driven model\\nacts as a strong signal for advertisers. According to the same survey, 61% of respondents said that they believe that ads on\\nReddit are more relevant than on other sites, and 61% of respondents stated that they pay more attention to ads on Reddit\\nthan on other sites.\\n•Ability to Connect with a High-Intent Audience Seeking Recommendations on the Path to Purchase. Many people come to\\nReddit, directly or through search, to find trusted recommendations across every phase of the purchase funnel. According to\\nthe Vertical Path to Purchase Survey, 75% of respondents said they believe Reddit is a trustworthy place to inform their\\ndecision to buy a new product across specified consumer product categories. The conversational nature of the platform\\nallows users to discover new products and services at the start of their purchasing journey. These conversations create a\\nunique opportunity for advertisers to engage Redditors who are considering brands and products. According to the Vertical\\nPath to Purchase Survey, 61% of Redditors in the market for a new product or service across a variety of categories said\\nthey would “purchase a product/brand if I saw an ad about it on Reddit.” According to the same survey, 73% of Redditors\\nsurveyed agree that they “can make a faster purchase decision based on experiences shared by other Redditors.” This\\nsuccessful experience is why 90% of monthly Redditors surveyed said they plan to use Reddit the “same or more” in the\\nyear ahead when it comes to researching their purchases, according to a 2023 survey of almost 2,000 Redditors across the year ahead when it comes to researching their purchases, according to a 2023 survey of almost 2,000 Redditors across the\\nUnited States, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Germany aged 18 and over.\\n•Unduplicated, Authentic, and Attentive Audience in an Attractive Demographic. In December 2023, the average active\\nminutes on Reddit per logged-in user in the United States was between 25 and 30 minutes per day, and there was an\\naverage of 73.1 million DAUq during the three months ended December 31, 2023. During this period, approximately 50%\\nof DAUq were from the United States, and the remainder were from the rest of the world. According to Comscore data\\nabout Redditors in the United States aged 18 and over, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, 41% were between\\nthe ages of 18 to 34, 50% were male, and 64% had a household annual income of $75,000 or more. Many Redditors are not\\nactive on traditional social media platforms; according to Comscore data for the three months ended December 31, 2023, of\\npeople who visited Reddit in the United States, 32% were not active on Facebook, 37% were not active on Instagram, 73%\\nwere not active on Snapchat, 41% were not active on TikTok, and 53% were not active on X.\\n•Gain Access to a Platform with Data Signals that is Built to Respect Privacy. The performance of our advertising model is\\nbased on first-party data from user-directed activities on the platform, such as the communities that users visit or subscribe\\nto for email digests and the context they are engaging in. The foundation of our ad performance is based on context and\\ninterest instead of tracking users based on personally identifiable information. This is unique in the digital advertising\\nmarketplace; our lack of reliance on third-party data makes our offering more resilient to the loss of signal that other\\nplatforms rely upon as well as forthcoming changes to the internet ecosystem. marketplace; our lack of reliance on third-party data makes our offering more resilient to the loss of signal that other\\nplatforms rely upon as well as forthcoming changes to the internet ecosystem.\\n•Action-Oriented Outcomes that Drive Attractive, Measurable Return on Investment. Advertisers can bid in our auctions in a\\nway that aligns with their objectives. They can bid to pay for the people they reach in video views or impressions.\\nAlternatively, they can bid for specific actions that are focused on objectives like mid-stream clicks and downstream\\nconversions or app downloads. Our rich contextual and interest-based audience and marketplace efficiency drives\\nincremental value for its advertisers.\\n•Multiple Layers of Brand Safety and Customizable Controls. Beyond our multiple layers of moderation and safety across\\nplatform content, we also offer advertiser-level controls. Our Content Policy establishes the type of content that is not\\nallowed across all communities, with community rules determining content within each community. In addition, our brand\\nsafety approach includes proactive solutions focused on creating a safe environment for any business on Reddit by showing\\nads in communities and alongside content that has been reviewed and deemed appropriate for advertising.\\n6 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 16/281Table of Contents\\nThe Future of Our Platform and Monetization Strategies\\nAdvertising\\nReddit is a unique place on the internet, and we believe that we have many avenues to increase value to advertisers through our\\ninterest- and community-based platform. We continue to expand our ad platform capabilities to enable more ways for customers to\\ninvest to grow their business on Reddit. We are still in the early phases of our opportunity and plan to pursue the following eight\\nlevers to expand our monetization and average revenue per unique:\\n1.More Context and Interest. We plan to continue to add additional contextual and interest-based signals and intelligence into\\nour advertiser platform. We believe this will help advertisers find more relevant audiences on Reddit. This includes existing\\nplacements in the home feed and in conversations, as well as potential future opportunities (e.g., ads in comment threads\\nand on search pages; video ads).\\n2.Deliver ROI with Marketplace Optimizations. We are in the early stages of using machine learning and prediction models to\\nbetter match supply and demand and deliver return on investment (“ROI”) for our advertisers. We are currently focused on\\nusing our powerful prediction models to work across objectives, placements, and formats – helping to better predict\\nconversion rates of an ad (e.g., installs; purchases).\\n3.Advertiser Diversity and Depth. We plan to increase the types, sizes, and geographies of advertisers we reach and expand\\nannual partnerships for longer-term visibility. We aim to grow our advertisers from endemic advertisers in verticals where\\nwe have the largest number of active communities, like technology and communications; business, legal, and finance; and\\nmedia and entertainment, to newer verticals such as automotive; retail; consumer packaged goods; pharmaceuticals; and', metadata={'page': 14, 'source': '/tmp/tmpphkw70ut', '_opper_id': '7747ed38-7afd-4e32-bf8e-1667e97b1d55', 'file_name': 'reddit-sec.pdf', '_opper_key': '34/1816/fcdadc07-9703-4496-83d5-3c96360c4a65', '_opper_next': '7fa6a6c0-8428-4871-8b36-23836d223f22', '_opper_prev': '90f9cce1-9303-4d84-a57f-f032b20c551c', '_opper_index_file_id': 2741, '_opper_pdf_processor': 'pypdf'})]\n"

We define a daily active unique (“DAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on\\nthe Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period. We calculate average DAUq for a particular\\nperiod by adding the number of DAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. We measure DAUq\\nbecause we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand usage of and engagement with our platform. DAUq is the primary\\nmetric by which we measure the scale of our active user base.\\nDAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do not have—a\\nregistered account. Visitors that come to Reddit from search engines are generally not logged in and originate from both desktop and mobile web.\\nCurrently, monetization of these users is mainly through conversation pages and feed ads. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and\\ncomplex. For example, prior to the first quarter of 2023, a portion of our historical DAUq metric counted views of pages that were hosted using\\nGoogle’s Accelerated Mobile Page (“AMP”) framework. The accuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relied on the accuracy\\nand completeness of information received from Google, which had not been historically complete and consistent. As such, our historical DAUq\\nmetrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To the extent that our metric includes views of pages hosted on third-party\\ninfrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party. infrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party.\\nDAUq is shown globally and also broken out by the United States and the rest of the world because these markets have different characteristics.\\nMost notably, we are more advanced in engagement and monetization in the United States than in the rest of the world.\\nIn addition, we monitor logged-in DAUq, which we define as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the\\nReddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period and was logged in to a registered account. We\\nmeasure logged-in DAUq because these users tend to have higher engagement and spend more time on our platform compared to users who are not\\nlogged in to a registered account. Logged-in users often start their experience in a personalized feed with advertising and dive into post pages with\\nconversation page ads. These ads include display, video, and direct response as well as other ads for mobile applications, mobile web, and desktop\\nweb.\\n97 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 107/281Table of Contents\\nQuarterly Average DAUq\\n(in millions)\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth: 5% 5% 7% 7% 5% 7% 15% 27%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth: 18% 18% 20% 17% 13% 14% 19% 21%\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth:(2)% (1)% 2% 6% 6% 9% 19% 34% Total DAUq YoY Growth:12% 11% 11% 7% 4% 5% 12% 21%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth:15% 16% 18% 15% 12% 12% 16% 20% Logged-in DAUq YoY Growth:21% 19% 21% 19% 14% 16% 22% 21%\\nWe assess both year over year and quarter over quarter growth of DAUq in each period.\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023, global DAUq grew 27% compared to the prior year period, driven by 34% growth in DAUq in the\\nUnited States and 21% growth in DAUq in the rest of world.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we deployed further advances in our\\nprocess used to identify and address activity by users and visitors, including web crawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove\\nthem from our DAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate DAUq for prior periods if we assess such impact to be immaterial. As we have\\ncontinued to improve our capabilities to identify suspicious traffic, we have not seen this methodology materially impact trends in DAUq from quarter\\nto quarter.\\nWeekly Active Unique. We define a weekly active unique (“WAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a\\npage on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a trailing seven-day period. We calculate average\\nquarterly WAUq for a particular period by adding the number of WAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that\\nperiod. We measure WAUq because we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand the reach of our platform.\\nSimilar to DAUq, WAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do\\nnot have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of not have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of\\ninformation received from third parties. As such, our historical WAUq metrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To\\nthe extent that our historical or future metric includes views of pages hosted on third-party infrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy\\nof our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the information received from any such third party. During the three months ended\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, we deployed further advances in our process used to identify and address activity by users and visitors, including web\\ncrawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove them from our WAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate WAUq for prior\\nperiods if we assess such impact to be immaterial. As we have continued to improve our capabilities to identify suspicious traffic, we have not seen this\\nmethodology materially impact trends in WAUq from quarter to quarter.\\nQuarterly Average WAUq\\n(in millions)\\nWAUq YoY Growth: 1% 1% 3% 3% 2% 5% 15% 29%\\nDAUq/WAUq: 27% 27% 27% 28% 28% 28% 28% 27%\\n99 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 109/281Table of Contents\\nWAUq Y oY Gr owth: (9)% (8)% (5)% 3% 4% 9% 21% 39% WAUq Y oY Gr owth: 10% 10% 11% 4% 1% 1% 9% 20%\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023, global WAUq grew 29% compared to the prior year period, driven by 39% growth in WAUq in the\\nUnited States and 20% growth in WAUq in the rest of world. In the three months ended December 31, 2023, global WAUq increased 12% compared to\\nthe prior quarter period, driven by 16% growth in WAUq in the United States and 8% growth in WAUq in the rest of world. For the three months\\nended December 31, 2023, the proportion of DAUq to WAUq was 27%.\\nTrends in Monetization Metrics\\nWe monetize our business primarily through advertising on our mobile applications and website. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we\\nrecorded revenue of $804.0 million, as compared to revenue of $666.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 21%\\ncompared to the prior year period.\\nARPU. We define average revenue per unique (“ARPU”) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average DAUq in that\\ngeography. For the purposes of calculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given geography is based on the geographic location in which advertising\\nimpressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity, while other revenue in a given geography is based on the billing address\\nof the customer. This differs from the presentation of our revenue by geography in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this prospectus, where both advertising revenue and other revenue are based on the billing address of the customer.\\nWe present ARPU globally and also broken out on a United States and rest of world basis because we currently monetize users in the United', page_number=106), Source(file_name='reddit-sec.pdf', content='04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 14/281Table of Contents\\n◦Elevating Conversations and Video. We believe that our investments and efforts to grow engagement and the richness\\nof our communities through more video, and more vibrant conversations will continue to convert our massive monthly\\nreach into more daily users. In December 2023, we experienced approximately 35% growth in the number of videos\\nwatched for 10 seconds or more and an approximately 16% increase in daily active video viewers compared to\\nDecember 2022. We also recognize that conversations are the heart of Reddit, with 27% of almost 3,200 Redditors\\nsurveyed across the United States, the UK, France, Germany, Mexico, and India identifying “reading comments” as\\ntheir top task to complete. In addition, we are focused on reducing the time it takes for users to access conversations, as\\nwell as providing them with better guidance on community rules when they comment to reduce moderated actions.\\n◦ Modernizing Search. While we are still in the early innings, search is already a key action taken on Reddit with an\\naverage of over 35 million daily search queries directly on Reddit in December 2023. We recognize the importance of\\nsearch, and have made significant investments to make searches more relevant and drive deeper engagement. We have\\nobserved 30% higher week-one retention (which measures the percentage of users who return to Reddit eight to 14\\ndays after first accessing Reddit) in users with any search activity compared to all users from October 2023 to\\nDecember 2023.\\n◦Customized Content Recommendations. We utilize AI to recommend relevant posts and communities, utilizing factors\\nsuch as search queries, post topics, and engagement with similar users to enhance both the search and discovery\\nexperience. We believe our investments in AI have improved new user onboarding and driven engagement with experience. We believe our investments in AI have improved new user onboarding and driven engagement with\\nexisting users. For example, we re-trained our New Home Feed ranking with significantly more data and user signals.\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023, we observed an\\nincrease of over 30% in “Good Visits,” defined as a user consuming a post for more than 30 seconds.\\n•Grow Our International User Base. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, approximately 50% of Redditors\\nvisited the platform from outside of the United States. In the three months ended December 31, 2023, over 90% of all\\nReddit posts were made in English. We see a massive opportunity to grow in geographies outside of the United States and\\nin languages beyond English. We are beginning the work of translating our corpus of conversational data using translation\\nmodels to multiple different languages to increase our international growth. In particular, we are focused on growing\\nRedditors in the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Brazil, and India. Our strategy to land in these markets and then grow is\\ncentered around offering users culturally relevant and location-specific content. We also intend to use the Community Tab,\\nmachine-translated content, and highly relevant push notifications to help international users find and engage regularly with\\nlocally relevant and trending content. We have captured increased international momentum, with an average of 36.7 million\\ninternational DAUq for the three months ended December 31, 2023, representing 21% growth year over year.\\nWhy Advertisers Come to Reddit\\nReddit is the place where people, entities of public interest, and businesses come together to engage in human-to-human\\nconversations relevant to their interests. Across our diverse communities, people seek and share information in context about conversations relevant to their interests. Across our diverse communities, people seek and share information in context about\\nproducts and services, often with high purchase intent. We have made investments and acquisitions that have enabled us to be a\\nleader in contextual and interest-based advertising. Advertisers of all sizes rely on Reddit to find high-intent customers that they are\\nnot able to reach on traditional social media platforms.\\nAdvertisers come to Reddit for distinctive benefits:\\n•Contextual and Interest-based Advertising. Reddit’s advertising platform enables marketers to find relevant audiences on\\nthe Reddit platform using our interest graph and to reach users in contextually relevant communities and content, using\\nconversational and engaging formats. According to the User Perceptions Survey, 85% of respondents said Reddit is where\\nthey learn about the topics they love most. For example, an advertiser with a camping product can reach people who love\\noutdoor activities across Reddit. This is interest-based advertising. Similarly, the same advertiser can reach people who are\\nin a conversation in\\n5 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 15/281Table of Contents\\nr/  camping or r/   Outdoors exploring what gear they should buy. These people may see an ad for camping gear, in context,\\nwithin that conversation. That is contextual advertising. Reddit’s unique community structure and interest-driven model\\nacts as a strong signal for advertisers. According to the same survey, 61% of respondents said that they believe that ads on\\nReddit are more relevant than on other sites, and 61% of respondents stated that they pay more attention to ads on Reddit\\nthan on other sites.\\n•Ability to Connect with a High-Intent Audience Seeking Recommendations on the Path to Purchase. Many people come to\\nReddit, directly or through search, to find trusted recommendations across every phase of the purchase funnel. According to\\nthe Vertical Path to Purchase Survey, 75% of respondents said they believe Reddit is a trustworthy place to inform their\\ndecision to buy a new product across specified consumer product categories. The conversational nature of the platform\\nallows users to discover new products and services at the start of their purchasing journey. These conversations create a\\nunique opportunity for advertisers to engage Redditors who are considering brands and products. According to the Vertical\\nPath to Purchase Survey, 61% of Redditors in the market for a new product or service across a variety of categories said\\nthey would “purchase a product/brand if I saw an ad about it on Reddit.” According to the same survey, 73% of Redditors\\nsurveyed agree that they “can make a faster purchase decision based on experiences shared by other Redditors.” This\\nsuccessful experience is why 90% of monthly Redditors surveyed said they plan to use Reddit the “same or more” in the\\nyear ahead when it comes to researching their purchases, according to a 2023 survey of almost 2,000 Redditors across the year ahead when it comes to researching their purchases, according to a 2023 survey of almost 2,000 Redditors across the\\nUnited States, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Germany aged 18 and over.\\n•Unduplicated, Authentic, and Attentive Audience in an Attractive Demographic. In December 2023, the average active\\nminutes on Reddit per logged-in user in the United States was between 25 and 30 minutes per day, and there was an\\naverage of 73.1 million DAUq during the three months ended December 31, 2023. During this period, approximately 50%\\nof DAUq were from the United States, and the remainder were from the rest of the world. According to Comscore data\\nabout Redditors in the United States aged 18 and over, for the three months ended December 31, 2023, 41% were between\\nthe ages of 18 to 34, 50% were male, and 64% had a household annual income of $75,000 or more. Many Redditors are not\\nactive on traditional social media platforms; according to Comscore data for the three months ended December 31, 2023, of\\npeople who visited Reddit in the United States, 32% were not active on Facebook, 37% were not active on Instagram, 73%\\nwere not active on Snapchat, 41% were not active on TikTok, and 53% were not active on X.\\n•Gain Access to a Platform with Data Signals that is Built to Respect Privacy. The performance of our advertising model is\\nbased on first-party data from user-directed activities on the platform, such as the communities that users visit or subscribe\\nto for email digests and the context they are engaging in. The foundation of our ad performance is based on context and\\ninterest instead of tracking users based on personally identifiable information. This is unique in the digital advertising\\nmarketplace; our lack of reliance on third-party data makes our offering more resilient to the loss of signal that other\\nplatforms rely upon as well as forthcoming changes to the internet ecosystem. marketplace; our lack of reliance on third-party data makes our offering more resilient to the loss of signal that other\\nplatforms rely upon as well as forthcoming changes to the internet ecosystem.\\n•Action-Oriented Outcomes that Drive Attractive, Measurable Return on Investment. Advertisers can bid in our auctions in a\\nway that aligns with their objectives. They can bid to pay for the people they reach in video views or impressions.\\nAlternatively, they can bid for specific actions that are focused on objectives like mid-stream clicks and downstream\\nconversions or app downloads. Our rich contextual and interest-based audience and marketplace efficiency drives\\nincremental value for its advertisers.\\n•Multiple Layers of Brand Safety and Customizable Controls. Beyond our multiple layers of moderation and safety across\\nplatform content, we also offer advertiser-level controls. Our Content Policy establishes the type of content that is not\\nallowed across all communities, with community rules determining content within each community. In addition, our brand\\nsafety approach includes proactive solutions focused on creating a safe environment for any business on Reddit by showing\\nads in communities and alongside content that has been reviewed and deemed appropriate for advertising.\\n6 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 16/281Table of Contents\\nThe Future of Our Platform and Monetization Strategies\\nAdvertising\\nReddit is a unique place on the internet, and we believe that we have many avenues to increase value to advertisers through our\\ninterest- and community-based platform. We continue to expand our ad platform capabilities to enable more ways for customers to\\ninvest to grow their business on Reddit. We are still in the early phases of our opportunity and plan to pursue the following eight\\nlevers to expand our monetization and average revenue per unique:\\n1.More Context and Interest. We plan to continue to add additional contextual and interest-based signals and intelligence into\\nour advertiser platform. We believe this will help advertisers find more relevant audiences on Reddit. This includes existing\\nplacements in the home feed and in conversations, as well as potential future opportunities (e.g., ads in comment threads\\nand on search pages; video ads).\\n2.Deliver ROI with Marketplace Optimizations. We are in the early stages of using machine learning and prediction models to\\nbetter match supply and demand and deliver return on investment (“ROI”) for our advertisers. We are currently focused on\\nusing our powerful prediction models to work across objectives, placements, and formats – helping to better predict\\nconversion rates of an ad (e.g., installs; purchases).\\n3.Advertiser Diversity and Depth. We plan to increase the types, sizes, and geographies of advertisers we reach and expand\\nannual partnerships for longer-term visibility. We aim to grow our advertisers from endemic advertisers in verticals where\\nwe have the largest number of active communities, like technology and communications; business, legal, and finance; and\\nmedia and entertainment, to newer verticals such as automotive; retail; consumer packaged goods; pharmaceuticals; and', page_number=14)]\n"
