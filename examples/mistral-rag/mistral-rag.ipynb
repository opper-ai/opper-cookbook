We define a daily active unique (“DAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on\\nthe Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period. We calculate average DAUq for a particular\\nperiod by adding the number of DAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. We measure DAUq\\nbecause we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand usage of and engagement with our platform. DAUq is the primary\\nmetric by which we measure the scale of our active user base.\\nDAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do not have—a\\nregistered account. Visitors that come to Reddit from search engines are generally not logged in and originate from both desktop and mobile web.\\nCurrently, monetization of these users is mainly through conversation pages and feed ads. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and\\ncomplex. For example, prior to the first quarter of 2023, a portion of our historical DAUq metric counted views of pages that were hosted using\\nGoogle’s Accelerated Mobile Page (“AMP”) framework. The accuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relied on the accuracy\\nand completeness of information received from Google, which had not been historically complete and consistent. As such, our historical DAUq\\nmetrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To the extent that our metric includes views of pages hosted on third-party\\ninfrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party. infrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party.\\nDAUq is shown globally and also broken out by the United States and the rest of the world because these markets have different characteristics.\\nMost notably, we are more advanced in engagement and monetization in the United States than in the rest of the world.\\nIn addition, we monitor logged-in DAUq, which we define as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the\\nReddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period and was logged in to a registered account. We\\nmeasure logged-in DAUq because these users tend to have higher engagement and spend more time on our platform compared to users who are not\\nlogged in to a registered account. Logged-in users often start their experience in a personalized feed with advertising and dive into post pages with\\nconversation page ads. These ads include display, video, and direct response as well as other ads for mobile applications, mobile web, and desktop\\nweb.\\n97 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 107/281Table of Contents\\nQuarterly Average DAUq\\n(in millions)\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth: 5% 5% 7% 7% 5% 7% 15% 27%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth: 18% 18% 20% 17% 13% 14% 19% 21%\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth:(2)% (1)% 2% 6% 6% 9% 19% 34% Total DAUq YoY Growth:12% 11% 11% 7% 4% 5% 12% 21%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth:15% 16% 18% 15% 12% 12% 16% 20% Logged-in DAUq YoY Growth:21% 19% 21% 19% 14% 16% 22% 21%\\nWe assess both year over year and quarter over quarter growth of DAUq in each period.\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023, global DAUq grew 27% compared to the prior year period, driven by 34% growth in DAUq in the\\nUnited States and 21% growth in DAUq in the rest of world. Global DAUq grew 11% compared to the prior quarter period, driven by 14% growth in\\nDAUq in the United States and 8% growth in DAUq in the rest of world. The growth in global DAUq in the three months ended December 31, 2023\\ncompared to the prior year period and prior quarter period was driven mainly by traction in our growth strategies, primarily from product\\nenhancements and third-party search engine and algorithm changes. Global monthly average DAUq was 76.0 million in December 2023, reflecting\\nmomentum in DAUq growth, particularly in logged-out users, as we exited the quarter, and we continued to add users in January 2024.\\nYear over year and quarter over quarter activity can also fluctuate due to various internal and external factors.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we deployed further advances in our\\nprocess used to identify and address activity by users and visitors, including web crawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove\\nthem from our DAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate DAUq for prior periods if we assess such impact to be immaterial. As we have\\ncontinued to improve our capabilities to identify suspicious traffic, we have not seen this methodology materially impact trends in DAUq from quarter\\nto quarter.\\nWeekly Active Unique. We define a weekly active unique (“WAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a\\npage on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a trailing seven-day period. We calculate average\\nquarterly WAUq for a particular period by adding the number of WAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that\\nperiod. We measure WAUq because we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand the reach of our platform.\\nSimilar to DAUq, WAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do\\nnot have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of not have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of\\ninformation received from third parties. As such, our historical WAUq metrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To\\nthe extent that our historical or future metric includes views of pages hosted on third-party infrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy\\nof our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the information received from any such third party. During the three months ended\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2023, we deployed further advances in our process used to identify and address activity by users and visitors, including web\\ncrawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove them from our WAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate WAUq for prior\\nperiods if we assess such impact to be immaterial.

We define average revenue per unique (“ARPU”) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average DAUq in that\\ngeography. For the purposes of calculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given geography is based on the geographic location in which advertising\\nimpressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity, while other revenue in a given geography is based on the billing address\\nof the customer. This differs from the presentation of our revenue by geography in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this prospectus, where both advertising revenue and other revenue are based on the billing address of the customer.\\nWe present ARPU globally and also broken out on a United States and rest of world basis because we currently monetize users in the United', metadata={'page': 106, 'source': '/tmp/tmppft3966t', '_opper_id': 'd2fd25f8-f0af-4328-a5f3-3775010186ea', 'file_name': 'reddit-sec.pdf', '_opper_key': '1/1652/6672572a-af9d-47d9-adeb-bd02da8e5a93', '_opper_next': '1a411e40-717f-45d4-b879-d3cf394b23a8', '_opper_prev': '06748da6-dd52-4add-b8f0-76e6608b7f9a', '_opper_index_file_id': 2511, '_opper_pdf_processor': 'pypdf'}), RetrievalResponse(content='04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 43/281Table of Contents\\nrestrictions, in combination with evolving legal and regulatory requirements, may impede our ability to attract and retain advertisers who rely on\\naccess to such data.\\nWe rely heavily on our ability to collect and share data and metrics to help new and existing advertisers understand the performance of advertising\\ncampaigns. If advertisers do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations of our user base and user engagement, or if we discover\\ninaccuracies in our metrics, they may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our platform, which could harm our business, results of\\noperations, financial condition, and prospects. See “—We rely on internal company data, assumptions, and estimates to calculate certain of our key\\nmetrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such current or historical metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.”\\nWe rely on external ecosystems, such as operating systems and application stores, to make our apps available to prospective users. If we are unable\\nto adapt to product and policy changes in such ecosystems, or if we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such\\necosystems, our usage could decline and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\\nWe depend in part on operating systems, including mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS, and their respective application stores,\\nsuch as Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store, to drive downloads of our apps. If such operating systems or application stores limit the\\navailability of our apps, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our apps, impose terms of use availability of our apps, make changes that degrade the functionality of our apps, increase the cost of using our apps, impose terms of use\\nunsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such mobile\\noperating systems’ application store is more prominent than the placement of our apps, our user growth could be adversely affected. Any changes in\\nsuch operating systems and application stores that degrade the functionality of our apps or give preferential treatment to our competitors’ apps could\\nadversely affect our platform’s usage across devices. For example, some operating systems have implemented or explored changes to the underlying\\napplication architecture, such as Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, or specialized infrastructure for advertisement-driven app installations, such as\\nSKAdNetwork, which reduce our ability to target and measure advertising and, in turn, may negatively impact the size of the budgets that advertisers\\nare willing to commit to us. Some marketplaces have explored changing their policies regarding what content is acceptable within an application. If we\\nare unable to adapt to such changes, this could adversely affect our platform’s access to and usage within those ecosystems.\\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will continue to support our platform\\nor effectively roll out updates to our apps. Additionally, in order to deliver high-quality apps, we need to ensure that our products and services are\\ndesigned to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or\\nmaintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance Redditors’ experience. If Redditors encounter any difficulty maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance Redditors’ experience. If Redditors encounter any difficulty\\naccessing or using our apps on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, our business, results\\nof operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\\nWe face intense competition for users with low switching costs and are subject to a rapidly evolving technological landscape. If we are unable to\\ncompete effectively for users, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\\nWe compete to attract and retain Redditors’ attention on the basis of our content and Redditor experiences with our platform and face significant\\ncompetition for prospective users, both domestically and internationally. We compete against many companies that provide content and\\ncommunications services to online users, including Google, Meta (including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp), YouTube, Wikipedia,\\nSnap, X, Pinterest, TikTok, Roblox, Discord, and Twitch, and which offer a variety of internet- and mobile device-based products, services, and\\ncontent. Many of these companies have greater financial resources and substantially larger user bases than Reddit. Furthermore, as we pursue\\nopportunities to empower our user economy, we expect to face competition from existing online marketplaces, including Facebook Marketplace,\\nNextdoor, Craigslist, Poshmark, Etsy, and Roblox. As a result, our competitors may draw users towards their products or services and away from ours.\\nThis could decrease the growth or engagement of Redditors, which, in turn, would negatively affect our business. In addition, we face competition\\nfrom large language models (“LLMs”), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Anthropic;\\n34 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 44/281Table of Contents\\nRedditors may choose to find information using LLMs, which in some cases may have been trained using Reddit data, instead of visiting Reddit\\ndirectly. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;\\n•the amount, quality, relevance, searchability, and timeliness of content available on our platform;\\n•the continued adoption of our products and services internationally;\\n•our ability, including in comparison to that of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products\\nand services;\\n•our ability to effectively adopt new technologies, such as machine learning and AI, that our competitors may have more experience utilizing\\nand leveraging in their products and services;\\n•changes mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements;\\n•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly engineers, designers, and product managers; and\\n•our reputation and the brand strength relative to our competitors.\\nIf we are not able to compete effectively for users, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects would be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe face intense competition for advertising spend and are subject to a rapidly evolving technological landscape. If we are unable to compete\\neffectively for advertising spend, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.\\nWe face significant competition for advertising spend. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated We face significant competition for advertising spend. We anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to be generated\\nthrough ads on our platform, and we compete against online and mobile businesses, including those referenced above, and traditional media outlets,\\nsuch as television, radio, and print, for advertising budgets. We also compete with advertising networks, exchanges, demand-side platforms, and other\\nplatforms for marketing budgets and in the development of the tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. In order to grow\\nour revenue and improve our results of operations, we must increase our share of advertising spend relative to our competitors, many of which are\\nlarger companies that offer more traditional and widely accepted advertising products. In addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially\\nbroader product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or services, as well as collect more personal data than we\\ndo, to gain additional share of advertising budgets. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for advertiser spend depends upon many factors\\nboth within and beyond our control, including:\\n•the size, composition, and engagement of our user base relative to those of our competitors;\\n•the availability of compelling and monetizable content on our platform;\\n•our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;\\n•our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;\\n•the pricing of our advertising products and services relative to those of our competitors;\\n•the strength of our advertiser relationships and services compared to those of our competitors;\\n•the ability for advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements on our platform;\\n35 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 45/281Table of Contents\\n•the return our advertisers receive from our advertising services relative to those of our competitors; and\\n•our reputation and the strength of our brand relative to our competitors.\\nIn addition, global economic concerns and geopolitical conditions continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability in the advertising market,\\nwhich we expect to increase competition for advertising spend. Furthermore, in recent years, there have been significant acquisitions and consolidation\\nby and among our actual and potential competitors. We anticipate this trend of consolidation will continue, which will present heightened competitive\\nchallenges for our business. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertiser spend, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and\\nprospects would be adversely affected.\\nWe have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk of\\nyour investment.\\nWe have a limited operating history in new and unproven markets that may not develop as expected. We began our operations in 2005, but were\\nacquired by Condé Nast Publications in 2006. We did not begin operating as an independent, private company until we were spun out of Advance\\nMagazine Publishers Inc. (“Advance”), Condé Nast’s parent company, in 2011. Additionally, we did not begin meaningful monetization efforts at\\nReddit until 2018, and we are currently exploring new strategies for monetization. Our limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate our\\ncurrent business and our future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by\\ngrowing companies in rapidly changing industries, including challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting, the need for ongoing changes to growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting, the need for ongoing changes to\\nour products and business strategy, and other risks and uncertainties described in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus. If our\\nassumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks\\nsuccessfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. Furthermore, there is no\\nassurance that our rate of growth will continue, if at all.\\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads, which could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition,\\nand prospects.\\nTechnologies have been developed, and will likely continue to be developed, that can block the display of our ads. We generate substantially all of\\nour revenue from advertising, and ad blocking technologies may prevent the display of certain of our ads, which could harm our business, revenue, and\\nfinancial results.

We define a daily active unique (“DAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on\\nthe Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period. We calculate average DAUq for a particular\\nperiod by adding the number of DAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that period. We measure DAUq\\nbecause we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand usage of and engagement with our platform. DAUq is the primary\\nmetric by which we measure the scale of our active user base.\\nDAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do not have—a\\nregistered account. Visitors that come to Reddit from search engines are generally not logged in and originate from both desktop and mobile web.\\nCurrently, monetization of these users is mainly through conversation pages and feed ads. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and\\ncomplex. For example, prior to the first quarter of 2023, a portion of our historical DAUq metric counted views of pages that were hosted using\\nGoogle’s Accelerated Mobile Page (“AMP”) framework. The accuracy of counting the DAUq attributable to this AMP traffic relied on the accuracy\\nand completeness of information received from Google, which had not been historically complete and consistent. As such, our historical DAUq\\nmetrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year. To the extent that our metric includes views of pages hosted on third-party\\ninfrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party. infrastructure, like Google’s AMP framework, the accuracy and comparability of our metrics will depend on the accuracy and consistency of the\\ninformation received from any such third party.\\nDAUq is shown globally and also broken out by the United States and the rest of the world because these markets have different characteristics.\\nMost notably, we are more advanced in engagement and monetization in the United States than in the rest of the world.\\nIn addition, we monitor logged-in DAUq, which we define as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a page on the\\nReddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a 24-hour period and was logged in to a registered account. We\\nmeasure logged-in DAUq because these users tend to have higher engagement and spend more time on our platform compared to users who are not\\nlogged in to a registered account. Logged-in users often start their experience in a personalized feed with advertising and dive into post pages with\\nconversation page ads. These ads include display, video, and direct response as well as other ads for mobile applications, mobile web, and desktop\\nweb.\\n97 04/05/2024, 23:15 Document\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm 107/281Table of Contents\\nQuarterly Average DAUq\\n(in millions)\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth: 5% 5% 7% 7% 5% 7% 15% 27%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth: 18% 18% 20% 17% 13% 14% 19% 21%\\nTotal DAUq YoY Growth:(2)% (1)% 2% 6% 6% 9% 19% 34% Total DAUq YoY Growth:12% 11% 11% 7% 4% 5% 12% 21%\\nLogged-in DAUq YoY Growth:15% 16% 18% 15% 12% 12% 16% 20% Logged-in DAUq YoY Growth:21% 19% 21% 19% 14% 16% 22% 21%\\nWe assess both year over year and quarter over quarter growth of DAUq in each period.\\nIn the three months ended December 31, 2023, global DAUq grew 27% compared to the prior year period, driven by 34% growth in DAUq in the\\nUnited States and 21% growth in DAUq in the rest of world. Global DAUq grew 11% compared to the prior quarter period, driven by 14% growth in\\nDAUq in the United States and 8% growth in DAUq in the rest of world. The growth in global DAUq in the three months ended December 31, 2023\\ncompared to the prior year period and prior quarter period was driven mainly by traction in our growth strategies, primarily from product\\nenhancements and third-party search engine and algorithm changes. Global monthly average DAUq was 76.0 million in December 2023, reflecting\\nmomentum in DAUq growth, particularly in logged-out users, as we exited the quarter, and we continued to add users in January 2024.\\nYear over year and quarter over quarter activity can also fluctuate due to various internal and external factors.

During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, we deployed further advances in our\\nprocess used to identify and address activity by users and visitors, including web crawlers and scrapers. As we identify automated agents, we remove\\nthem from our DAUq count prospectively and do not recalculate DAUq for prior periods if we assess such impact to be immaterial. As we have\\ncontinued to improve our capabilities to identify suspicious traffic, we have not seen this methodology materially impact trends in DAUq from quarter\\nto quarter.\\nWeekly Active Unique. We define a weekly active unique (“WAUq”) as a user whom we can identify with a unique identifier who has visited a\\npage on the Reddit website, www.reddit.com, or opened a Reddit application at least once during a trailing seven-day period. We calculate average\\nquarterly WAUq for a particular period by adding the number of WAUq on each day of that period and dividing that sum by the number of days in that\\nperiod. We measure WAUq because we believe that this metric helps management and investors understand the reach of our platform.\\nSimilar to DAUq, WAUq includes visits from those who have logged in to a registered account as well as those who have not logged in to—or do\\nnot have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of not have—a registered account. Measuring the number of logged-out visitors is difficult and complex and relies on the accuracy and completeness of\\ninformation received from third parties. As such, our historical WAUq metrics are not directly comparable quarter over quarter or year over year.

For the three months\\nended December 31, 2023, the proportion of DAUq to WAUq was 27%.\\nTrends in Monetization Metrics\\nWe monetize our business primarily through advertising on our mobile applications and website. In the year ended December 31, 2023, we\\nrecorded revenue of $804.0 million, as compared to revenue of $666.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of 21%\\ncompared to the prior year period.\\nARPU. We define average revenue per unique (“ARPU”) as quarterly revenue in a given geography divided by the average DAUq in that\\ngeography. For the purposes of calculating ARPU, advertising revenue in a given geography is based on the geographic location in which advertising\\nimpressions are delivered, as this approximates revenue based on user activity, while other revenue in a given geography is based on the billing address\\nof the customer. This differs from the presentation of our revenue by geography in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included\\nelsewhere in this prospectus, where both advertising revenue and other revenue are based on the billing address of the customer.\\nWe present ARPU globally and also broken out on a United States and rest of world basis because we currently monetize users in the United We present ARPU globally and also broken out on a United States and rest of world basis because we currently monetize users in the United\\nStates and the rest of the world at different rates. We measure ARPU because we believe that this metric helps our management and investors assess\\nthe extent to which we are monetizing our DAUq. Monetization of new users is generally at a lower rate than existing users and as such, ARPU tends\\nto grow at a lower rate than revenue in periods of strong DAUq growth. Additionally, logged-out users typically have lower engagement and spend less\\ntime on our platform compared to users who are logged in to a registered account, and therefore, logged-in users generally contribute significantly\\nmore to ARPU than logged-out users due to the lower monetization opportunity of logged-out users. Our ARPU reflects the seasonality of our\\nadvertising revenue, with the fourth quarter typically being the strongest quarter of each year, especially in the United States, our most developed\\ngeography. United States ARPU is higher primarily due to the relative size and maturity of the U.S. digital advertising market, a dynamic we expect\\nwill continue for the foreseeable future.\\n100', metadata={'page': 107, 'source': '/tmp/tmppft3966t', '_opper_id': '1a411e40-717f-45d4-b879-d3cf394b23a8', 'file_name': 'reddit-sec.pdf', '_opper_key': '1/1652/6672572a-af9d-47d9-adeb-bd02da8e5a93', '_opper_next': '8a889325-6557-4168-8663-679d14435a60', '_opper_prev': 'd2fd25f8-f0af-4328-a5f3-3775010186ea', '_opper_index_file_id': 2511, '_opper_pdf_processor': 'pypdf'})]\n"
